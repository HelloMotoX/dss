Darwin Streaming Server for Ubuntu

Two packages are here - download either the 32 or 64 bit package (whichever is appropriate for your machine), and run

Note: The 64 bit package has had minimal testing - if you try it out, please let me know how you go

$ sudo dpkg -i <packagename>
Once it's installed you can open the admin interface at http://<ip>:1220 - the default username is admin, and the password is admin - you'll want to change this.

See the Download tab for the packages.

You can also checkout the code to built it yourself

hg clone http://bitbucket.org/lstoll/dss/
or tarballs of the source can be found at http://bitbucket.org/lstoll/dss/downloads/

If you have any problems please log them in the Issue Tracker

A big thanks goes out to the people on the streaming-server-dev group for the awesome patches I've used here!
